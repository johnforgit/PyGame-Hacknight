# How it works?
The game works as a first person shooter game. Here, the aliens move sideways and ultimately reach you. The aim is to shoot as many as them possible and earn the highest score. There is a tune in the background and when a hit is confirmed an explosion sound happens and the score is increased. This is how the game works.
